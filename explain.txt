This code is an implementation of three different page replacement algorithms: LRU, FIFO and OPT.

The first algorithm, LRU, uses a least-recently-used approach to page replacement. A frame buffer array is used to store the pages that are currently in memory,
 and a timestamp array is used to keep track of the last time each page in the buffer was accessed. When a page fault occurs, the page in the buffer that has the oldest
  timestamp is replaced with the new page.

The second algorithm, FIFO, uses a first-in, first-out approach to page replacement. A frame buffer array is used to store the pages that are currently in memory.
 When a page fault occurs, the oldest page in the buffer is replaced with the new page.

The third algorithm, OPT, uses an optimal approach to page replacement. A frame buffer array is used to store the pages that are currently in memory. When a page fault occurs, 
the page in the buffer that will not be used for the longest time in the future is replaced with the new page.

Each algorithm takes an integer array as an input which is used as the reference string, the size of the reference string, and the number of frames in memory.
 They return the number of page faults that occurred during the simulation.
